This notebook is part of a peer-reviewed submission to the journal of the Communications for the Association of Information Systems (CAIS).

To run the notebook, users must have Python version 3.12 or higher installed on their computers. There are two primary methods for installing Python: 1) through the Anaconda distribution (available at https://www.anaconda.com/download), or 2) via a manual installation from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/download). We recommend using the Anaconda distribution because it also installs most of the necessary packages to run the notebook, including the Jupyter Notebook application which is required. Therefore, the instructions provided in this document and in the notebook are tailored for the Anaconda distribution.

After installing the Anaconda distribution, we recommend starting the terminal window and performing the following steps:
- Create a new environment for the purposes of this tutorial using the following command: `conda create -n mlflow-env python=3.12`
- Switch to the new environment using the following command: `conda activate mlflow-env`
- Install the necessary packages in this environment using the following command: `conda install -c conda-forge mlflow, ipython, jupyter`

After the installation is complete, users can open the notebook using the Jupyter Notebook application available at the Anaconda Navigator.
